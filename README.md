# Real-Time Map with Route Simulation

## Purpose

- The main purpose of this project is to provide a simple example of how to create a real-time map application using React Native and Expo. It demonstrates how to request location permissions, track the user's location in real-time, and display it on a map. Additionally, it simulates movement by continuously updating the marker's position as if you were following a route.
